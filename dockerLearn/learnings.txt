Docker -> Tool to install softwares without headache.
It creates an isolated env in our system and allotes some physical resources in order to run container.

The images is something from which we create the container, it contains configurations, etc.
Image basically consists of File system snapshots(files, applications we want in a container) and Startup command(like what command to be issued when container runs.)
when we write "docker run hello-world", it searched image chache for hello-world image, if not found, it downloads from docker hub on internet and puts in image cache.
It then creates container for that and show us the message.

when we write any command, the command first go to docker client, which process the command and then to docker server(daemon-> running in background.).

docker basically runs on linux, as it uses control groups to specifcally allots the hardware to each container, 
and namespace to seprate the docker containers from ech other -> Isolotion of processes of container to host machine and other container.


docker run = docker create(container from image) + docker start(container)

docker run image-name -> creates and starts container
docker create image-name overide-command -> returns id
docker start -a id -> attaches to docker container and runs the command.
docker ps -> all running containers
docker ps --all -> all stopped as well as running containers
docker logs id -> shows output of command of that container.
docker system prune -> deletes every container as well as it's resources
docker container prune -> deletes all containers only.
docker run -it image sh -> opens shell.
docker exec -it id command -> run multiple commands in running container.(another terminal)
-it -> interactive terminal flag.



dockerfile -> it is a configuration file, what all softwares, packages, we need to 
run that software, and how our container should behave.

dockerfile -> docker cli -> docker server -> usable docker image

flow
	specify base image
	run some commands to install additional packages, programs
	specify command to be run at startup


docker build -t(tagging name) ide .(dockerfile) -> creates image
docker run ide

docker run -p localport:appPort(inside container) image_name -> port forwarding -> It forward local port to appport in our container's network ports.
